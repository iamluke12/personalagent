Overview
- A Python-powered tool for priority-based calendar management with AI-powered task automation.
- Family events take priority. Work tasks adapt to life events.
- It combines calendar management with AI-driven task automation to help you stay organized without burning out.

What this project is for
- You manage a busy life. Your calendar should reflect your priorities, not the other way around.
- The system watches family commitments and work obligations as they surface in your calendar and suggests and executes automation policies to keep you on track.
- It blends human judgment with automation. You decide what matters; the AI helps you act on it.

What you will find here
- A command-line tool that connects to your calendars, plans your day, and runs automated tasks.
- A flexible priority model that favors family events while balancing work obligations.
- Helpers to integrate with Google Calendar and other calendar services.
- A modular design that supports multiple large language models (LLMs) for planning, reasoning, and action.

Quick start
- This project aims to be simple to install and easy to use. The command-line interface is designed for speed and clarity.
- Prerequisites: Python 3.11 or newer, a Google account for Google Calendar access, an internet connection, and basic terminal skills.
- Install: You typically install via a package manager or a script provided in the releases. The file on the Releases page should be downloaded and executed. After installation, you will have a command named personalagent.
- Connect: You must authorize access to your calendar services. The tool guides you through a secure OAuth flow for Google Calendar and other calendars you choose to connect.
- Run: Start the app from the terminal. The system will load your calendar data, apply priority rules, and present automated actions to your review.

Features
- Priority-based scheduling: The core feature prioritizes family events above other commitments while ensuring work tasks still get done when possible.
- AI-assisted planning: The system uses AI to reason about your day, propose actions, and adapt to changes.
- Multi-LLM orchestration: The architecture can coordinate multiple language models for planning, reasoning, and action.
- Calendar integration: It connects to Google Calendar and can integrate with other calendar services you use.
- Task automation: Repetitive tasks are automated with safety checks and manual override options.
- Command-line interface: Lightweight, fast, and scriptable for power users.
- Configurable policies: You can customize how strict or flexible the schedule should be based on your life.

How it works
- Data ingestion: The system pulls calendar events and related metadata from connected calendars.
- Priority assessment: A rule-based and model-driven engine assigns priority to events, with family events receiving top weight.
- Action planning: The AI proposes a set of actions (reminders, tasks, rescheduling, auto-commit of follow-up tasks) to align with the priorities.
- Execution: Actions are carried out through integrations and user-approved steps. The CLI can apply changes automatically or present options for user approval.
- Learning loop: The system adapts over time by observing outcomes and refining the priority mechanism.

System architecture
- CLI frontend: A fast, local command-line interface for quick control and automation.
- Core engine: The heart of the tool. It handles scheduling, prioritization, and AI interactions.
- AI layer: One or more large language models used to analyze your calendar, propose actions, and reason about priorities.
- Integrations module: Connectors for Google Calendar and other calendars.
- Persistence layer: Local storage for policies, preferences, and a lightweight cache of events.
- Security layer: Secrets handling, token refresh, and access control to protect your data.

Configuration and setup
- Configuration is stored in a simple YAML file. You can customize:
  - Calendar providers (Google, others)
  - Priority rules for family vs. work
  - Notification preferences
  - Which actions to automate
- Example snippet (config.yaml):
  - calendar_provider: google
  - google_credentials_path: ~/.config/personalagent/credentials.json
  - priority_policy:
      family_weight: 0.75
      work_weight: 0.25
      max_daily_changes: 3
  - automation:
      auto_reschedule: true
      auto_complete_tasks: false
  - notifications:
      enabled: true
      channels:
        - email
        - desktop
- The configuration is designed to be approachable for new users while offering depth for power users.

Calendar integration
- Google Calendar: Uses OAuth 2.0 to access your events. It can read, create, update, and delete events as needed.
- Other calendars: The architecture supports additional providers through adapters. If you use a non-Google calendar, you can enable a corresponding adapter.
- Permissions: The tool requests only the minimum permissions required to function. You can adjust scopes in the OAuth configuration.
- Synchronization: The system keeps a local cache and periodically synchronizes with the calendar providers to stay up to date.

Task automation and AI models
- AI planning: The AI analyzes your calendar, tasks, and preferences to propose actions that align with priorities.
- Action automation: The system can automatically reschedule, create follow-up tasks, or set reminders. You have the final say before any changes are committed.
- Model selection: The multi-LLM approach allows swapping models as needed. You can use a primary model for planning and a secondary model for reasoning and safety checks.
- Safety and oversight: The tool includes checks to prevent unintended deletions or drastic changes. You can enable strict mode to require explicit confirmation for major actions.
- Learning and adaptation: Over time, the AI improves by learning from outcomes, adjusting weightings, and refining action policies.

Data model and privacy
- Events: Core calendar events with times, titles, locations, and metadata.
- Priorities: Weights assigned to events, such as family events, work commitments, and personal tasks.
- Actions: A log of proposed and executed actions for transparency and auditing.
- Preferences: User-defined rules and policies that shape the schedule.
- Privacy: All sensitive data remains on the device unless you choose to share it. The tool uses encryption for stored data and follows best practices for credential handling.

CLI reference (short guide)
- Initialize config: personalagent init
- Connect calendars: personalagent connect google
- Run scheduling pass: personalagent schedule
- Review suggested actions: personalagent review
- Apply actions: personalagent apply
- Show status: personalagent status
- Edit config: personalagent config edit
- Help: personalagent --help

Examples
- Quick example: A family dinner on Friday is flagged as high priority. The AI suggests moving a lower-priority meeting to a later time and creates a reminder for the event, informing you of the reasoning.
- Auto-reschedule example: If a work meeting conflicts with a family event, the system proposes shifting the work task to a different time block with a note explaining the rationale.

Security and privacy
- Local-first design: Most data stays on your device; you choose what to sync with the cloud.
- Encryption: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit where applicable.
- Secrets management: The tool uses a secure storage mechanism for tokens and credentials.
- Access control: You control who can view and modify your calendar data.
